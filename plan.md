### A musical guide for travellers

##### UI / UX ideas
Basic:
- user can select a country from a dropdown list and they will see a list musical recommendations on the screen (a top 10)
- musical recommedations should be the traditional and/or popular music of that country

Extension: 
- allow for broader search functionality
- generate playlists based on the results or suggest existing playlists
- user selects country from a map
- be more regionally-specific
